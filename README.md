# rdiffbackupApp
Bash script apt to automate my rdiff_backup backups, using a menu and a default backup file set, or a backup set from a text file.

Using -f <backupDescriptionFile.txt> tells rdiffbackupApp that it should override the default backup files and locations with the contents of the file.
